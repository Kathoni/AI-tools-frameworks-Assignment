# Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

## 1. Ethical Considerations

Identify potential biases in your MNIST or Amazon Reviews model. How could tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators or spaCy's rule-based systems mitigate these biases?

### Potential Biases

- **MNIST Model**: The MNIST dataset primarily consists of handwritten digits from a specific demographic, which may not represent all handwriting styles globally. This can lead to biases in recognizing digits from underrepresented groups or regions.

- **Amazon Reviews Model**: The sentiment analysis model may be biased based on the keywords used. For example, if the training data predominantly contains reviews from certain demographics or regions, the model might not accurately reflect the sentiment of all users.

### Mitigation Strategies

- **TensorFlow Fairness Indicators**: These tools can help identify and quantify biases in your model by analyzing performance across different demographic groups. By using these indicators, you can adjust your model to ensure fair treatment across all groups.

- **spaCy's Rule-Based Systems**: For NLP tasks, spaCy's rule-based systems can be used to create more inclusive and diverse training datasets. By incorporating a wider range of linguistic patterns and cultural contexts, the model can better generalize across different demographics.

## 2. Troubleshooting Challenge

Buggy Code: A provided TensorFlow script has errors (e.g., dimension mismatches, incorrect loss functions). Debug and fix the code.
